# Chapter 11: File Systems
<hr>

## 11.1 Attributes
*Metadata* ‚Äì attributes associated with a file (e.g. name, access rights, ... etc.)
- The space that metadata takes up is called *overhead*

**List of attributes**
1. Name
We often use a hierarchical system like the one shown below
![[Pasted image 20220504171911.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.1: Multi-level directory</i></p>

Some OS require files to have an extension (e.g. `.txt` or `.docx`). Other systems such as UNIX and Windows just use the extension to guess how to render and open the file.

An *alias* allows the user to create a "nickname" for a file
- `ln foo bar` creates an alias bar for the file foo
	- This is called a *hard link*
	- If we delete the file `foo`, we can still access it through `bar`
	- These two have the same i-node
	- `bar` will point to the same file as `foo`, so think of it as another reference to the same object. Deleting just `foo` only deletes one reference
	- ![[Pasted image 20220504172442.png]]
- `ln -s foo bar` creates an alias as well, but it is a `soft link`
	- This is called name equivalence and `bar` only points to `foo` instead of the actual file
	- ![[Pasted image 20220504172449.png]]
	- Note how the size of `bar` is only 3 bytes, since it just contains the pointer to foo
	- If you delete `bar` now, the file still exists. However, if you delete `foo`, trying to access the file through `bar` will result in an error

<mark class="hltr-green">Soft links improve usability</mark> . <mark class="hltr-pink">However, it has to resolve the alias by traversing its internal data structures.</mark> 

<mark class="hltr-green">Hard links improve performance as there is no time traversing internal data structures</mark> , <mark class="hltr-pink">but it can lead to circular lists (which makes it really hard to delete directories). For this reason, Unix disallows creating hard links to directories</mark> 

2. Access Rights
This attribute specifies *who* has access to a particular file and *what* kind of privilege each allowed user enjoys. 

**Chmod**
```bash
chmod u+x virus.sh
```
Allows for the changing the permission mode of a file. In the above command, we are giving execute privileges to the user
- `r` ‚Äì¬†read privileges
- `w` ‚Äì write privileges
- `x` ‚Äì execute privileges

**Chown**
```bash
chown richard virus.sh
```
Allows for changing ownership of a file.

Ideally, we may want to give individual access rights to each user in the system to each file in the system. Unix divides this into three groups: user, group, and all
- User is a specific user of the system
- Group is the set of authorized users
- All refers to all authorized users

**Chgrp**
```bash
chgrp cs2200 virus.sh
```
Makes `cs2200` the group owner of `virus.sh`

**Example metadata of a file**
```bash
rwxrw-r--   1 rama     fac   2364 Apr 18 19:13 foo
```
- The first three bits encode read, write, and execute privileges for rama
- The next three bits encode read and write privileges for group fac (no execute)
- The final three bits encode read privilege only for all users

The ‚Äú1‚Äù after the access rights states the number of hard links that exists to this file

3. Creation Time
Time when the file was created first

4. Last Write Time
Time when the file was last written. In most file systems the creation time attribute is the same as the last write time attribute
- Note: moving a file doesn't change last write time

5. Size
Total space occupied on the file system

## 11.2 Design Choices
One of the fundamental design issues in file system is the physical representation of a file on the disk
- Sequential access
	- Commands like `cat`, `more`, `less` that read the contents sequentially
- Random access
	- Searching through the file
	- Commands like `tail`, `grep`

We also need to consider what happens when the file grows in size and how to allocate the space on the disk efficiently

Therefore the *figures of merit* for a file system design are:
- Fast sequential access
- Fast random access
- Ability to grow the file
- Efficient allocation of storage
- Efficiency of space utilization on the disk

We are going to use a 4-tuple for the disk address `(cylinder#, surface#, sector#, size of disk block)`

### 11.2.1 Continuous Allocation
![[Pasted image 20220504174302.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.2: Directory that maps file name to a disk block address for contiguous allocation</i></p>

At file creation time, the file system pre-allocates a fixed amount of space to the file
- Amount of space is determined by file type (e.g. `.txt` or `.wav`)

The file system keeps a free list of available disk blocks
![[Pasted image 20220504174511.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.3: Free list with blocks pointing to disk addresses for contiguous allocation</i></p>

Allocation of disk blocks to a new file may follow one of first fit or best fit policy. Deletion returns the blocks to the free list
- Compaction is not very efficient due to the overhead
- Suffers from external and internal fragmentation

The file system keeps this data structure (queue) both in persistent memory (the disk itself) and also caches it in memory for faster lookup

<mark class="hltr-pink"><b>Problems</b></mark>
1. File cannot grow in size beyond the allocation
2. Significant internal and external fragmentation

<hr>

**Example**
Given the following
```
Number of cylinders on the disk = 10000
Number of platters = 10
Number of surfaces per platter = 2
Number of sectors per track = 128
Number of bytes per sector = 256
Disk allocation policy = contiguous cylinders
```

a). How many cylinders are required to store a file of size 3 Mbytes?
$\text{Number of tracks in a cylinder} = \text{Num platters} \cdot \text{Surfaces/Platter} = 10 \cdot 2 = 20$
$\text{Size of track} = \text{Sectors/Track} \cdot \text{Bytes per sector} = 128 \cdot 256 = 2^{15} \text{ bytes}$
$\text{Size of cylinder} = \text{Tracks/Cylinder} \cdot \text{Size of track} = 20 \cdot 2^{15} \text{ bytes}$
$\textbf{Num Cylinders} = \left \lceil{\dfrac{3 \cdot 1024 \cdot 1024}{20 \cdot 2^{15}}}\right \rceil = 5 \text{ cylinders}$

b). How much internal fragmentation is there?
$\textbf{Internal fragmentation} = 5 \cdot (20 \cdot 2^{15}) - (3 \cdot 2^{20}) = 131,072 \text{ bytes}$

<hr>

### 11.2.2 Contiguous Allocation with Overflow Area
This strategy is the same as the previous one with the difference that the file system sets aside an *overflow* region that allows spillover of large files that do not fit within the fixed partition
- Overflow region consists of physically contiguous regions allocated to accommodate such spillover of large files
- File system needs *an additional* data structure to manage the overflow region

### 11.2.3 Linked Allocation
In this scheme, the file system deals with allocation at the level of individual disk blocks
- We also use a free list of available disk blocks
- File occupies as many file blocks as it needs
- Free list may actually be a linked list of the disk blocks with each block pointing to the next free block on the disk

**Insertion**
We cache the location of the head and dequeue from head of free list

**Deletion**
Add disk blocks to free list

**Performance**
Using an actual LinkedList is rather slow traversing, so we often use a bit vector (one bit for each disk block. The block is free if the corresponding bit is 0 and busy if it is 1)

**Difference To Contiguous Allocation**
- No guarantee the blocks allocated are contiguous

![[Pasted image 20220504180909.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.4: Linked Allocation</i></p>

<mark class="hltr-green">Advantages</mark> 
- Fast allocation since it is one disk block at a time
- Accommodates easy growth of files
- No external fragmentation due to on-demand allocation
- No disk compaction

<mark class="hltr-pink">Disadvantages</mark> 
- Slow random access (since disk blocks are not contiguous)
- Seek time is slow even for sequential (retrieving pointers takes time)
- Any bug in the list maintenance code leads to a complete breakdown of the file system

### 11.2.4 File Allocation Table (FAT)
Variation of Linked Allocation. A table on the disk, *File Allocation Table (FAT)*, contains the linked list of the files currently populating the disk
- Scheme divides disk into logical partitions
- Each partition has a FAT
- The *free/busy field* indicates the availability of that disk block (0 for free; 1 for busy)
- The *next field* gives the next disk block of the linked list that represents a file
- A *distinguished value* (`-1`) indicates this entry is the last disk block for that file
- A single directory for the entire partition contains the file name to FAT index mapping

![[Pasted image 20220504181406.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.5: File Allocation Table (FAT)</i></p>

For example, /foo occupies two disk blocks: 30 and 70. The next field of entry 30 contains the value 70, the address of the next disk block. The next field of entry 70 contains -1 indicating this is the last block for /foo. Similarly, /bar occupies one disk block (50). If /foo or /bar were to grow, the scheme will allocate a free disk block and fix up the FAT accordingly.

<mark class="hltr-green">Advantages</mark> 
- Less chance of errors compared to the linked allocation
- By caching FAT in memory, the scheme leads to efficient allocation times compared to linked allocation
- Performs similar to linked allocation for sequential file access (*arguably bad too*)
- Performs better than linked allocation for random access since the FAT contains the next block pointers for a given file

<mark class="hltr-pink">Disadvantages</mark> 
- Logical partitioning leads to a level of management of the space on the disk for the end user that is not pleasant
- Creates an artificial scarcity of space on the disk even when there is physical space

<hr>

**Example**
`foo` occupies disk blocks 1, 2 and 3
`bar` occupies disk blocks 10, 13, 15, 17, 18 and 19
`gag` occupies disk blocks 4, 5, 7 and 9

<hr>

### 11.2.5 Indexed Allocation
This scheme allocates an *index disk block* for each file
- Index block is a fixed-size data structure that contains addresses for data blocks that are part of that file
	- Essentially, this scheme aggregates data block pointers for a file scattered all over the FAT data structure into one table per file
- This table called *index node* or *i-node*, occupies a disk block
- The *directory* contains the the *file name* to *index node* mapping for each file
- Maintain a free list as a bit vector of blocks

![[Pasted image 20220504182225.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.6: Indexed Allocation</i></p>

<mark class="hltr-green">Advantages</mark> 
- Better random access time than FAT

<mark class="hltr-pink">Disadvantages</mark> 
- Limit to max file size (i-node is a fixed size data structure per file with direct pointers to data blocks)
	- **Max file size = number of data block points in an i-node**

**Calculations**
Size of i-node = size of sector
Minimum amount of space for a file = size of i-node + size of data block
Number of data block pointers in an i-node = size of i-node / size of data block pointer
Maximum size of file = Number of data block pointers in i-node * size of data block

### 11.2.6 Multilevel Indexed Allocation
This scheme fixes the limitation in the indexed allocation by making the i-node for a file an indirection table
- With one level indirection, each i-node entry points to a first level table, which in turn points to the data blocks
- The scheme can be extended to make an i-node a two (or even higher) level indirection table depending on the size of the files that need to be supported by the file system

<mark class="hltr-pink">Disadvantages</mark> 
- Small files that may fit in a few data blocks have to go through extra levels of indirection

![[Pasted image 20220504182651.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.7: Multilevel Indexed Allocation (one level of indirection)</i></p>

### 11.2.7 Hybrid Indexed Allocation
Combines the ideas from the previous two schemes
- Every file has an i-node
- Accommodates all the data blocks for small file with direct pointers
- If the file size exceeds the capacity of direct blocks, then the scheme uses single or more levels of indirection for the additional data blocks

![[Pasted image 20220504182846.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.8: Hybrid Indexed Allocation</i></p>

## 11.3 Putting It Together
UNIX uses a hybrid allocation approach with hierarchical naming
- To allow for aliasing, the i-node also includes a reference count field

## 11.4 Components of the File System
**Media Independent Layer**
- This layer consists of the user interface, i.e. the Application Program Interface (API) provided to the users
- Consists of the name resolver

**Media Specific Storage Space Allocation Layer**
- Embodies the space allocation (on file creation), space reclamation (on file deletion), free-list maintenance, and other functions associated with managing the space on the physical device

**Device Driver**
- Deals with communicating the command to the device and effecting the data transfer between the device and the operating system buffers

**Media Specific Requests Scheduling Layer**
- Scheduling requests from OS commensurate with the physical properties of the device

![[Pasted image 20220504184117.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.12: Layers of a disk-specific file system manager</i></p>

### Anatomy of Creating a File
1. The **API routine** for creating a file calls validates the call by checking the permissions, access rights, and other related information for the call. After such validation, it calls the name resolver.
2. The **name resolver** contacts the storage allocation module to allocate an i-node for the new file
3. The **storage allocation module** gets a disk block from the free list and returns it to the name resolver. The storage allocation module will fill in the i-node commensurate with the allocation scheme (see Section 11.2). Let us assume the allocation in effect is the hybrid scheme (Section 11.2.7). Since the file has been created without any data as yet, no data blocks would have been allocated to the file
4. The **name resolver** creates a directory entry and records the name to i-node mapping information for the new file in the directory

Notice that these steps do not involve actually making a trip to the device since the data structures accessed by the file system (directory and free list) are all in memory

### Anatomy of Writing To A File
1. As before the API routine for file write will do its part in terms of validating the request.
2. The name resolver passes the memory buffer to the storage allocation module along with the i-node information for the file.
3. The storage allocation module allocates data blocks from the free list commensurate with the size of the file write. It then creates a request for disk write and hands the request to the device driver.
4. The device driver adds the request to its request queue. In concert with the disk-scheduling algorithm, the device driver completes the write of the file to the disk.
5. Upon completion of the file write, the device driver gets an interrupt from the disk controller that is passed back up to the file system, which in turn communicates with the CPU scheduler to continue the execution of your program from the point of file write

As far as the OS is concerned, the file write call is complete **as soon as the request is handed to the device driver**
- Success/failure will be interrupt

## 11.5 Interaction among the various subsystems
We got too many subsystems in an OS running (e.g. VM Manager, Scheduler, ... etc.). We just upcall stuff until it works.

## 11.6 Layout of the file system on the physical media
How does BIOS know where to even find the OS? What about which OS to load?
- Master Boot Record (MBR) knows what to do
- BIOS just finds MBR and executes it

If you have multiple OSes (like me), you have to partition
![[Pasted image 20220504185050.png]]
<p style="text-align: center; width: 80%; margin: auto"> <i> Figure 11.13: Layout of each partition</i></p>

***Superblock*** contains all the information pertinent to the file system contained in this partition
- The boot program (in addition to loading the operating system or in lieu thereof) reads in the superblock into memory
- Typically contains a code usually referred to as the magic number that identifies the type of file system housed in this partition, the number of disk blocks, and other administrative information pertaining to the file system
- If superblock is corrupted, you're fucked

### I/O Issues
Users typically will create a bunch of intermediary files, so it's not optimal to always write to I/O devices. Thus, the OS will wait and then flush the files to update the file system (the reason why you have "it's not safe to remove the device")

## 11.7 Dealing With System Crashes
In UNIX, the operating system automatically runs *file system consistency check (fsck)* on boot up
- Makes sure in-memory data structures and on-disk versions are the same

There's also more stuff like Virtual File Systems, NTFS, and Unix
